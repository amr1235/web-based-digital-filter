# Digital Filter Design
 a website that helps users to design a custom digital filter via zeros-poles placement on the z-plane
## features
A plot for the z-plane with the unit circle, where the user can place different zeros and poles. The user can also make the following modifications:
- Modify the placed zeros/poles by dragging them,
- Click on a zero or pole and delete it,
- Clear all zeros or clear all poles or clear all,
- Has the option to add conjugates or not for the complex elements

A plot that shows the corresponding frequency response for the placed elements: One graph for the magnitude response and another graph for the phase response.
